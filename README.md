# BerkTuner

BerkTuner is a fun project which streams what you listen with a cool audio visualizer. It can work cross browser and allows sound level controls too (in case you use it in your office like I do and forget to keep the volume down when you go out, your coworkers can easily mute it for you through the web portal :) )
